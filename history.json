We see some food that looks good, our brain says, \"Calories! Survival!\" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. After a while, our creative brains say, \"What? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is?\" \"Why don't you try eating something good you'll feel better?\" we ask our brains. We quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better. Same process, just a different trigger. Later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity an morbidity. Sutter: What if instead of fighting our brains, we tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process. He says mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. In fact, with mindfulness training, we even told them to smoke, Sutter says. \"What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?\" The majority of smokers had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. With mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes shit. She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones. She started to become disenchanted with her behavior. The prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain, understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Habits, which is why this disenchantment is ****important****. Summarize. ONLY using content from the transcript. Important terms to preserve: learning, process, food, good, smoking, something, feel. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level. As we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that being really interested in with what's happen. Mindfulness is just about getting close and personal with what's happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. Our old, f. In one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. When we get curious, we old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point. It might sound too simplistic to affect behavior, but in one study it works. The brain is activated when we get caught up in a craving. When we let go, this same brain region quiets down. We're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms. The same technology that's driving us to distraction could help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors. We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. The next time you feel an urge to check your email or stress eat, try to tap into your natural capacity to be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.

Use this transcript to help students with reading comprehension and vocabulary. CNN i. Report. The author pored over hundreds of research papers from front to back at his office. How does technology influence our attention and our ability to focus? The research around this particular area is fascinating. It turns out to doing something else, and when we have things. Slack open. Research shows that when we do work in front of a computer, especially when our phone is nearby, we focus on one thing for just 40 seconds before we switch to doing something else. It's not that we're distracted; it's that our brains are overstimulated. Our brains love these tiny little nuggets of information and social media and email and these things that we do over the course of the day. There's even a mechanism in our mind called the \"novelty bias,\" by which with a hit of dopamine. We're at this hyperstimulated state where we bounce around between these bunch of different objects of attention that are very, very stimulating for our mind. And we not only crave distraction, but our mind rewards us for seeking out and finding distraction in the first place. We get that same stimulation when we check. Facebook.

The author says that when we let our attention rest, it goes to three ****main**** places: We think about the past, we, and we plan for the future. The author calls this mode \"scatter focus,\" and it lets our mind come up with ideas, he says. \"Not all those who wander are lost,\" says. J. R.

This is why when we're taking a shower, we plan out our entire day, even though it hasn't started yet. It's because the rest of the time, our mind is dull, it's blank, or it doesn't have an idea inside of it that is rooted in time. Mine happens to be something that is not necessarily stereotypic of my age and gender demographic, but. I love to knit. The presenter talks about letting your mind wander, something that's simple and doesn't consume your full attention. Her favorite hobby is knitting, which she does on planes, trains and in hotel rooms. She says it helps calm you down, it helps settle your nerves and she comes up with many ideas when she knit. On. CNN i. Report. Work walking from one room to another in the office - very simple change - but if you don't use your phone during that walk, your mind will go to the meeting that you're about to attend. Ask your masseuse to let you have a notepad in the session because ideas always come to you and you're always incubating things, capture them you can act upon them later. We need to make two fundamental shifts with regard to how we think about our attention. We don't need to fit more in. We're doing enough; we're doing too much. This is when our best ideas and plans come to us. We need more space. The second shift: we to think of distraction as the enemy of focus. It is a symptom of why we find it difficult to focus. The two-week challenge is to make your mind a bit less stimulated. Have a disconnection ritual every evening. One of my favorite daily rituals: I disconnect from the.

Marlboro. Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool,. Trigger, behavior, reward., after a while, our creative brains say: \"What? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is?\" We learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better. Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. We've gone from learning to survive to killing ourselves with these habits. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention,. We instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process. But added a twist? What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process? \"Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's when you do,\" says one researcher. \"Mindful smoking: smells stinky cheese and tastes chemicals, YUCK!\" The majority of smokers had tried to force themselves to quit smoking. What did they notice? She said, \"Mindful smoking: smells stinky cheese and tastes chemicals, YUCK!\" We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of. Our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. The prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain, understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. Unfortunately, this is also the first part that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. Seeing what we getting from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level. To know it in our bones we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior, we're just less interested in doing it. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel? It feels good. And what happens when we're curious? We find out. Mindfulness is just about getting close and personal with what's happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. When we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point. It might sound too simplistic to affect behavior, but in one study, mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. In one study, mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. When we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. One current hypothesis is that a region of this network is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, and it takes us for a ride. In contrast, when. We let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. When we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down.

Journalists, Factually phrases used by the continent's journalists and columnists years, including the use of the word \"gratification\" to describe a person's immediate reaction when they hear a word they don't understand, and the meaning of \"this\" when it's used to describe someone's reaction to something they're about to see, such as a film, a.

Journalists, a non-procrastinator and why he's been receiving emails from people who are having a hard time getting their projects done because of long-term, procrastination-related problems, such as regretting not being able to achieve their dreams, or wishing they had done something else instead of doing what they're doing at the moment, cramming for a deadline, or trying to get a project done on time, when in fact, it's not even possible to do any of those things, because they've been doing them for a long time, and they just don't feel they can do them any more. -American journalists, some people are emailing him about their long-term procrastination, and what he's doing to help them get their lives back on track. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. The. Instant.

ask you a ****question**** what is the single most important skill needed to be an extraordinary hitter much in tennis they said reading the pitch was the most important skill I said great the same is true in tennis I've developed a number of mindful awareness base exercises that can really help with reading the pitch and the coach who asked the ****question**** his jaw dropped because the ****answer**** was never I don't know much about baseball technique but I have learned some innovative coaching techniques that might prove very helpful now in the course of the next six months we identified other critical variables that were important for hitting and pitching and by the end of the season they went from being ranked 23 as a group to number one my number one recommendation would

financial crisis of 2008 there was only one large Bank that did not take any money from the US government US bank a friend of mine Josef adding who became vice chairman I asked him how did you do it how is this possible when everyone else made the mistake of investing in subprime mortgages he said it was really simple I brought the senior leadership team in I told them that these were the five critical variables that were crucial for our success and that we would focus on them then I say ask Joe what did you do next he said what I I just played a lot of golf and it sounds funny but this is how powerful this simple tool is but as I mentioned focus is not just important for performance it's also critical for learning I remember some years ago a man came to me wanting to improve his back end when I tossed him a couple of balls I asked him to simply be aware of where the racket was relative to his shoulder on the backswing but on the fourth ball suddenly something happened and he exclaimed oh I do take the racket back too high it's above my shoulder there is a distinct difference between knowing something cognitively and knowing something in our own direct experience in 2001 I was invited to work with the New York Yankee player development group I was introduced and I shared with them that I really wanted this to be a conversation and an inquiry and that they could ask questions any time they wanted immediately a hand shot up and one of the coaches asked mr. Brawley with all due respect what can you as a former tennis pro teach us about baseball and I said I can't teach you much about baseball I haven't played baseball since I was 10 years old but let me ask you a ****question**** what is the single most important skill needed to be an extraordinary hitter much in tennis they said reading the pitch was the most important skill I said great the same is true in tennis I've developed a number of mindful awareness base exercises that can really help with reading the pitch and the coach who asked the ****question**** his jaw dropped because the ****answer**** was never I don't know much about baseball technique but I have learned some innovative coaching techniques that might prove very helpful now in the course of the next six months we identified other critical variables that were important for hitting and pitching and by the end of the season they went from being ranked 23 as a group to number one my number one recommendation would be to meditate that in the course of meditating you get to practice your focus and you get to practice noticing what comes up in you in the present moment and I'll leave you with that thank you very much [Applause]", "sentiment": 0.20288536395065923, "timestamp": "2025-08-28T22:08:26.357049"}, {"video_id": "arj7oStGLkU", "title": "Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator | Tim Urban | TED", "summary": "And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't that plan, he takes the wheel, and he says, \", let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, that happened.
